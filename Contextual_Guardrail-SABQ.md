# CONTEXTUALGUARDRAIL.md

*AI Development Assistant Guidelines & Constraints*

## 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

### Essential Reading

- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of any new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, technology stack, and constraints.  
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting any new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.  
- **Reference project vision**: Personal budgeting web app for middle-aged South Africans facing economic pressures.  
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.

### Context Validation

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**  
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.  
- **Verify dependencies** are listed in package.json before using them in code.  
- **Check existing code patterns** and maintain consistency with established conventions.

## 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

### File Size & Organization

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into:  
  - Feature-specific modules  
  - Helper utility files  
  - Separate concerns (business logic, UI components, API handlers)  
  - Configuration files

### Project Structure

- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility:  
    
  src/  
    
  ├── components/          \# Reusable UI components  
    
  ├── pages/              \# Next.js pages/routes  
    
  ├── features/           \# Feature-specific modules  
    
  ├── lib/                \# Utility functions and configurations  
    
  ├── hooks/              \# Custom React hooks  
    
  ├── types/              \# TypeScript type definitions  
    
  ├── styles/             \# CSS and styling files  
    
  └── \_\_tests\_\_/          \# Test files

### Import Standards

- **Use consistent imports** with clear hierarchies:  
    
  // External libraries first  
    
  import React from 'react'  
    
  import { NextPage } from 'next'  
    
  // Internal imports \- absolute paths from project root  
    
  import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'  
    
  import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/use-auth'  
    
  // Relative imports for same directory or close modules  
    
  import { BudgetForm } from './budget-form'  
    
  import { calculateBudget } from '../utils/budget-calculations'

## 🔧 Technology Standards

### Frontend Development (React/Next.js)

- **Use TypeScript** for all new files with strict type checking  
- **Functional components** with hooks (no class components)  
- **Next.js App Router** for routing (not Pages Router)  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with consistent design system  
- **React Hook Form** for form handling with Zod validation  
- **Zustand** for state management (not Redux)

### Backend Development (Node.js/Express)

- **TypeScript** for all backend code  
- **Express.js** with proper middleware structure  
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations  
- **Zod** for input validation and type safety  
- **JWT** for authentication with refresh token strategy

### Database Standards

- **Prisma** as the primary ORM  
- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage  
- **Redis** for caching and session management  
- **Proper indexing** for performance-critical queries  
- **Migration-first** approach for schema changes

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability

### Test Requirements

- **Always create tests for new features** (functions, components, API routes, etc.)  
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing tests need updates  
- **Minimum test coverage**: Aim for 80% code coverage  
- **Test file naming**: `filename.test.ts` or `filename.spec.ts`

### Test Structure

- **Tests should live in a `__tests__` folder** or alongside the file being tested:  
    
  src/  
    
  ├── components/  
    
  │   ├── budget-form.tsx  
    
  │   └── \_\_tests\_\_/  
    
  │       └── budget-form.test.tsx  
    
  ├── utils/  
    
  │   ├── calculations.ts  
    
  │   └── \_\_tests\_\_/  
    
  │       └── calculations.test.ts

### Test Types & Coverage

Include at least:

- **1 test for expected use case** (happy path)  
- **1 edge case test** (boundary conditions)  
- **1 failure case test** (error handling)  
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints  
- **Component tests** for React components

### Testing Frameworks

- **Frontend**: Jest \+ React Testing Library  
- **Backend**: Jest \+ Supertest for API testing  
- **E2E**: Playwright for critical user journeys

## ✅ Task Management & Completion

### Task Workflow

- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them  
- **Add new sub-tasks or TODOs** discovered during development to `TASK.md` under "Discovered During Development"  
- **Update task status** with brief completion notes  
- **Create new tasks** for any bugs or improvements found during development

### Documentation Updates

- **Update `README.md`** when:  
  - New features are added  
  - Dependencies change  
  - Setup steps are modified  
  - Environment variables are added  
- **Update API documentation** for any new endpoints or changes

## 📚 Code Quality & Style

### TypeScript Standards

- **Strict TypeScript configuration** enabled  
- **Type definitions** for all function parameters and return values  
- **Interface definitions** for all data structures  
- **Avoid `any` type** \- use proper typing or `unknown`  
- **Generic types** where appropriate for reusability

### Code Style

- **ESLint \+ Prettier** configuration enforced  
- **Consistent naming conventions**:  
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions  
  - `PascalCase` for components and classes  
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants  
  - `kebab-case` for file names  
- **Clear variable names** that explain purpose  
- **Small, focused functions** (max 20-30 lines)

### Documentation Standards

- **JSDoc comments** for all exported functions:  
    
  /\*\*  
    
   \* Calculates monthly budget allocation based on income and priorities  
    
   \* @param income \- Monthly gross income in ZAR  
    
   \* @param priorities \- Array of budget priorities with percentages  
    
   \* @returns Calculated budget allocation per category  
    
   \*/  
    
  export function calculateBudgetAllocation(  
    
    income: number,  
    
    priorities: BudgetPriority\[\]  
    
  ): BudgetAllocation {  
    
    // Implementation...  
    
  }  
    
- **Inline comments** for complex logic explaining the "why", not the "what"  
- **README updates** for new features or setup changes

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Guidelines

### Data Protection

- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, financial information)  
- **Validate all inputs** using Zod schemas  
- **Sanitize user inputs** to prevent XSS attacks  
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection  
- **Implement rate limiting** on API endpoints

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens** with proper expiration times  
- **Refresh token rotation** for security  
- **Role-based access control** where needed  
- **Secure password hashing** using bcrypt  
- **Input validation** on all authentication endpoints

### South African Compliance

- **POPIA compliance** for personal data handling  
- **Financial regulation compliance** for banking integrations  
- **Data residency** requirements consideration  
- **Audit logging** for financial transactions

## 🌍 South African Context Requirements

### Localization

- **Currency formatting** in South African Rand (ZAR)  
- **Date formatting** in South African format (DD/MM/YYYY)  
- **SA ID number validation** using proper algorithms  
- **Banking details validation** for South African account numbers

- **Never use `any` type** in TypeScript without justification  
- **Never hardcode sensitive values** \- use environment variables  
- **Never skip input validation** on user-facing endpoints  
- **Never commit secrets** to version control

### Architecture Violations

- **Never create circular dependencies** between modules  
- **Never put business logic in UI components**  
- **Never bypass the established authentication system**  
- **Never create direct database connections** outside of the ORM layer  
- **Never ignore error handling** in async operations

### Library & Dependency Rules

- **Never add dependencies** without checking if they're already available  
- **Never use deprecated libraries** or methods  
- **Never import entire libraries** when only specific functions are needed  
- **Never use different libraries** for the same purpose without justification
